These are the commands supported by FokaBot, our chat bot.  

### General commands
- `!roll` - Returns a random number from 0 to 100  
- `!roll num` - Returns a random number from 0 to num  
- `!help` - Display help message  
- `!pp [mode]` - Show your current pp. If `mode` is not present, FokaBot will tell you the amount of PP for your current game mode. If mode is present (it can be `std/taiko/ctb/mania`), FokaBot will tell you the amount of PP for that gamemode. **This command works only in PMs**
- `!update` - Update the beatmapset you've `/np`ed in our beatmap mirror. Use this if you've just downloaded a beatmap from osu!direct and it shows as outdated or if a beatmap can't be downloaded from osu!direct because it's too new.

### Faq commands
- `!faq rules`  
- `!faq swearing`  
- `!faq spam`  
- `!faq offend`  
- `!faq english`  
- `!faq github`  
- `!faq discord`  
- `!faq blog`  
- `!faq changelog`  
- `!faq status`  

### Tillerino-like commands
Fokabot has some commands similar to Tillerino. Those commands work only if you send them to Fokabot through a PM. Remember that PP system has been implemented only on osu!standard and osu!mania. The bot doesn't support beatmaps recommendations at the moment, that functionality wil come later, hopefully.

- `/np` - Show PP for the current playing song  (only if is a osu! standard song)  
- `!last` - Show info (and gained PP, if it was an osu! standard score) about the last submitted score  
- `!with <mods>` - Show PP for the previous requested beatmap with requested mods. Supported mods are `NF, EZ, HD, HR, DT, HT, NC, FL, SO.`. Don't use spaces for multiple mods (eg: `!with HDHR`)
